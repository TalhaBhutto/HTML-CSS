            Though the Karachi region has been inhabited for millennia,the city was founded as the fortified village of Kolachi in 1729.The settlement drastically increased in importance with the arrival of British East India Company in the mid 19th century. The British embarked on major works to transform the city into a major seaport, and connected it with their extensive railway network.By the time of the Partition of British India, the city was the largest in Sindh with an estimated population of 400,000.
